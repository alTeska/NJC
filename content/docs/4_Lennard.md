<center><h4>1. Histological evaluation of flexible neural implants; flexibility limit for reducing the tissue response? Lee, et al. <br> </h4>
<h4>by Lennard de Graaf<br> </h4></center>

<div style="text-align: justify">OBJECTIVE:
Flexible neural probes are hypothesized to reduce the chronic foreign body response (FBR) mainly by reducing the strain-stress caused by an interplay between the tethered probe and the brain's micromotion. However, a large discrepancy of Young's modulus still exists (3-6 orders of magnitude) between the flexible probes and the brain tissue. This raises the question of whether we need to bridge this gap; would increasing the probe flexibility proportionally reduce the FBR?<br><br>

APPROACH: Using novel off-stoichiometry thiol-enes-epoxy (OSTE+) polymer probes developed in our previous work, we quantitatively evaluated the FBR to four types of probes with different softness: silicon (~150 GPa), polyimide (1.5 GPa), OSTE+Hard (300 MPa), and OSTE+Soft (6 MPa). <br><br>

MAIN RESULTS: We observed a significant reduction in the fluorescence intensity of biomarkers for activated microglia/macrophages and blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness around the three soft polymer probes compared to the silicon probe, both at 4 weeks and 8 weeks post-implantation. However, we did not observe any consistent differences in the biomarkers among the polymer probes.<br><br>

SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that the mechanical compliance of neural probes can mediate the degree of FBR, but its impact diminishes after a hypothetical threshold level. This infers that resolving the mechanical mismatch alone has a limited effect on improving the lifetime of neural implants.

Francisco presented to use the results of his 9 week research project, that is a part of MSNE curriculum. He decided to shar e his impression of the research itself and presented his results.
