Beyond the era of gold and silicon<br>
by Dr. Nouran Adly</h4></center>

<div style="text-align: justify">Fundamental investigations of bioelectrical signals in neural and cardiac systems commonly rely on silicon-based microelectrode arrays (MEAs). While these MEAs have been extensively utilized to record and stimulate electrical activity of cells both in-vitro and in-vivo, which render them promising tools in medicine, these devices are typically developed on stiff and synthetic substrates, e.g. glass, silicon or polyimide, that neither physically mimic nor mechanically match the structure of living tissues. In-vitro, the stiff substrate alters cell shape, organization and function and therefore does not provide scientists with a real model close to the natural cellular behavior with soft surrounding tissues. In-vivo, the stiff synthetic substrate triggers inflammatory response indicating rejection of the electronic interface and thus precluding successful translation of these probes to clinical research. We present a novel functional soft MEA for effective interfacing with cardiac cells. The soft MEAs are directly deposited on PDMS, agarose, and gelatin-based substrates including gummy bears using inkjet printing as a patterning tool. We demonstrate the versatility of the printing technology by depositing high-resolution microelectrode patterns and explore the potential of the soft MEAs for in vitro extracellular recording of action potentials from HL-1 cells. Our results represent a step toward the design of a soft bioelectronic interface for next-generation bio-implants in a rapid prototyping and easy‐to‐fabricate approach.<br><br></div>

Paper abstract:<br>

<div style="text-align: justify">OBJECTIVE:
Flexible neural probes are hypothesized to reduce the chronic foreign body response (FBR) mainly by reducing the strain-stress caused by an interplay between the tethered probe and the brain's micromotion. However, a large discrepancy of Young's modulus still exists (3-6 orders of magnitude) between the flexible probes and the brain tissue. This raises the question of whether we need to bridge this gap; would increasing the probe flexibility proportionally reduce the FBR?<br><br>

APPROACH: Using novel off-stoichiometry thiol-enes-epoxy (OSTE+) polymer probes developed in our previous work, we quantitatively evaluated the FBR to four types of probes with different softness: silicon (~150 GPa), polyimide (1.5 GPa), OSTE+Hard (300 MPa), and OSTE+Soft (6 MPa). <br><br>

MAIN RESULTS: We observed a significant reduction in the fluorescence intensity of biomarkers for activated microglia/macrophages and blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness around the three soft polymer probes compared to the silicon probe, both at 4 weeks and 8 weeks post-implantation. However, we did not observe any consistent differences in the biomarkers among the polymer probes.<br><br>

SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that the mechanical compliance of neural probes can mediate the degree of FBR, but its impact diminishes after a hypothetical threshold level. This infers that resolving the mechanical mismatch alone has a limited effect on improving the lifetime of neural implants.
