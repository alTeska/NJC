HTM is a technology of artificial intelligence that was inspired by the human neocortex.

HTM is different then the current trend of deep learning, in the sense that it is strictly kept biologically plausible and comprehensive with current neuroscience knowledge.
Therefore, it can serve the purpose of solving the human brain by looking at a consistently simplified model, or eventually become a General Artificial Intelligence by reverse-engineering the only best model we have of it, the human brain. All that without distractions of non-biological techniques.<br>
Since Jeff Hawkins founded the HTM theory of intelligence in 2004, the theory and applications keep evolving.<br>

Join our presentation & discussion for an introduction to this promising research and overlook of the current state-of-the-art.
