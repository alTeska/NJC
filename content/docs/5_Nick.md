<h4>About our speaker:</h4>
Nicholas A. Del Grosso, is a postdoctoral researcher in Proteomics, at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry.  During his PhD, he designed and built a virtual reality system for freely-moving rodents in the Sirota Lab (Cognition and Neural Plasticity) at LMU. He is not only a passionate neuroscientist but also a professional Pythonista, having written several high- and low-level Python libraries. In the upcoming NJC event, Nicholas will talk about Productivity in Science.
<br> <br>

<h4>Talk:</h4>
In his talk, Nicholas Del Grosso will pose two key questions: What is the purpose of science, and what does it mean to be productive in science? Being inspired by the Agile and Lean management frameworks from industry, Nicholas will show alternative ways for both daily work and lab management, to make scientists more engaging and efficient. Some of the topics (among many more) that are planned for discussion:
</div>
* setting and tracking your goals
* workflow models and their impact on production
* agile development tools
* selecting a project management tool
* risk management for research and engineering projects
* essential problem-solving skills for a productive scientist
* good collaboration practices
* the impact of culture and communication on daily work
